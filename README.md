# Model yolov8 fine tune for player detection on minecraft

##**Info :**
Fine tune on https://hub.ultralytics.com/
The model is store in : "player_detection on minecraft 04 (gpu).pt"

##**Tuto :**
You can easely reproduce this for any things. There are many tutorials for it ex : https://medium.com/@arthur.lagacherie/implement-the-xlstm-paper-from-scratch-with-pytorch-3a2a4ddb4f94.

* First create a dataset with a special organization describe in https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/#ultralytics-yolo-format 
I use https://www.cvat.ai/ for create my dataset it's very simple.

* Second go to the hub https://hub.ultralytics.com/ go to model/train model and create a new one at the 3 step of creation you must do a choice : train on google colab (for free gpu) or train on your computer.

* Third wait and it's good. üëç

Good luck !!
